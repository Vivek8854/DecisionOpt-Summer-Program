A company manufactures a food product by refining and blending five types of raw oils—two vegetable oils (VEG 1 and VEG 2) and three non-vegetable oils (OIL 1, OIL 2, and OIL 3)—each of which can be purchased monthly at varying prices and stored up to 1,000 tons per oil type at a monthly cost. The final product, which sells for £150 per ton, must be produced using separate refining lines for vegetable and non-vegetable oils, with monthly refining limits of 200 tons for vegetable oils and 250 tons for non-vegetable oils. Neither the final product nor refined oils can be stored, and there is a technological constraint requiring the blended product’s hardness (which blends linearly based on the hardness values of each oil) to be between 3 and 6 units. The company starts with 500 tons of each oil in storage and must have the same amount at the end of June. The objective is to determine the optimal buying and manufacturing policy over a six-month period to maximize profit while satisfying all production, storage, and quality constraints
